## About The Project

Did you know that nutrition plays a bigger role in fitness than exercise? Believe it or not, health expert says that a healthy diet plays a staggering 80% role towards overall fitness.

Which is why we built Nutrific! We wanted to give our users a way to learn about what is in their food while tracking important information about what they eat.

Here's why:

- Understanding nutrition should be easy.
- We want you to have the necessary information regarding your diet at your fingertips.
- We've built our interface to be easy-to-use, and gorgeous. We kept you, the user, in mind when we built our app.
- Let's work together to make your nutrition the best it can be. Let's eat terrific with Nutrific!
