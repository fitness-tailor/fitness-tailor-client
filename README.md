## About The Project

Did you know that nutrition plays the biggest role towards your overall fitness? Believe it or not, health expert says that a healthy diet plays a staggering 80% role towards overall fitness.

Which is why we built Nutrific! We wanted to provide our users with an application that allows them to grow on their own unique nutritional journey.

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused towards your unique nutritional goals. Let us worry journaling and displaying your goals and data for you.
- We understand that nutrition can be hard, which is why we've built our easy-to-use, yet gorgeous interface with you, the users, in mind.
- Let us work together to live your best life.
